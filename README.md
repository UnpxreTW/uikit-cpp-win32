uikit-cpp-win32
===========

Framework for C++ Win32 that was quite heavily inspired by Apple's UIKit (and its dependencies).

Note: this is being extracted from an older project I did for Windows Mobile 5 Pocket PC and as such may not compile/run out of the box for every win32 platforms, though there is a good chance it will since it uses very low level win32 APIs.
