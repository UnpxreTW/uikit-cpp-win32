uikit-cpp-win32
===========

Framework for C++ Win32 that was quite heavily inspired by Apple's UIKit (and its dependencies). Originally used only on Windows Mobile 5 Pocket PC, this is a total rewrite that is slowly attempting to work on any NT kernel. It still needs some serious love. I'm not a Windows user, so it's really been an adventure learning the lower level APIs.
